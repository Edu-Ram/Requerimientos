The Proxy design pattern is a software development pattern that allows objects to act as
placeholders or surrogates for other objects. It provides a way to control access to an
object, add additional functionality, or provide a more efficient way to use the object.

A case where the Proxy pattern can be applied is in a system where there is a need to
control access to a resource that is expensive to create or slow to load. For example,
consider a system that needs to load large images from a server. Loading the image
directly every time it is needed can be slow and inefficient. A better approach would
be to use a Proxy object to manage the loading and caching of the image.


Code:
In this example, the Image interface defines the interface for loading and displaying
images. The RealImage class implements the Image interface and provides the actual
implementation for loading and displaying images. The ImageProxy class acts as a
surrogate for the RealImage class and provides the same interface as the Image
interface. The ImageProxy class checks if the RealImage object has been created,
and if not, it creates a new RealImage object. The ImageProxy class then delegates
the load and display methods to the RealImage object.
